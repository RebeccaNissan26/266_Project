FEE SCHEDULE.\\n\\n    (a) For the purpose of this section the terms:\\n            (1) ``Sixteen Western States'' means WA, CA, ID, NV, NM, \\n        WY, CO, KS, SD, ND, NE, OR, OK, AZ, UT and MT.\\n            (2) ``AUM'' means an animal unit month as that term is used \\n        in the Public Rangeland Improvement Act (92 Stat. 1803);\\n            (3) ``Authorized Federal AUMs'' means all ``allotted AUMs'' \\n        reported by BLM and ``permitted to graze AUMs'' reported by \\n        USFS.\\n            (4) ``WAPLLR'' means the weighted average private land \\n        lease rate determined by multiplying the private land lease \\n        rate reported by the Economic Research Service for the previous \\n        calendar year for each of the sixteen Western States by the \\n        total number of authorized Federal AUMs, as defined in section \\n        3(a)(3), in each State for the previous fiscal year, then that \\n        result divided by the total number of authorized Federal AUMs \\n        for the sixteen Western States. These individual State results \\n        are then added together and divided by 16 to yield a weighted \\n        average private land lease rate for that year.\\n            (5) ``Report'' means the report titled ``Grazing Fee Review \\n        and Evaluation Update of the 1986 Final Report'' dated April \\n        30, 1992 and prepared by the Departments of the Interior and \\n        Agriculture.\\n            (6) ``Nonfee cost differential'' means a value calculated \\n        annually by the Secretaries by multiplying the weighted \\n        difference in nonfee costs per AUM between public land and \\n        private land by the Input Cost Index (ICI) determined annually \\n        by the Department of Agriculture. The weighted difference in \\n        nonfee costs is a factor of 0.552 determined by deducting the \\n        private AUM nonfee costs (as outlined on page 58 of the report) \\n        from the public AUM nonfee costs for cattle times 4, added to \\n        the result of deducting private AUM nonfee costs from public \\n        AUM nonfee costs for sheep times 1, then that result divided by \\n        5.''\\n            (7) ``Net production differential'' is the percentage \\n        calculated annually by dividing the cash receipts per cow for \\n        Federal permittee livestock producers by the cash receipts per \\n        cow for western non-Federal livestock producers in the sixteen \\n        Western States as surveyed by the Economic Research Service in \\n        annual cost of production surveys (COPS).\\n            (8) ``PLFVR'' means the private lease forage value ratio \\n        determined by dividing the average of the 1964-1968 base years' \\n        private land lease rate into the forage value portion of the \\n        private land lease rate of $1.78 as determined in the 1966 \\n        western livestock grazing survey.\\n    (b) The Secretaries of the Department of Agriculture and the \\nDepartment of the Interior shall calculate annually the Federal forage \\nfee by calculating the average of the WALLPR for the preceding three \\nyears; multiplying it by the PLFVR; then deducting from that result the \\nnonfee cost differential; and multiplying that result by the net \\nproduction differential. For each year that this calculation is made, \\nall data used for calculating this fee shall come from the calendar \\nyear previous to the year for which the fee is being calculated unless \\nspecified otherwise in the above calculations.\\n    (c) The Federal forage fee shall apply to all authorized Federal \\nAUMs under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of \\nAgriculture and the United States Department of the Interior.\\n    (d) For the first year that the Secretaries calculate the Federal \\nforage fee, the fee shall not be greater than 125 percent, or less than \\n75 percent of the fee calculated for the previous year pursuant to \\nExecutive Order 12548 dated February 14, 1986.

Eisenhower, acknowledged that ``through the \\n        prompt delivery of supplies and equipment to our armed forces \\n        overseas, and of cargoes representing economic and military aid \\n        to friendly nations, the American Merchant Marine has \\n        effectively helped to strengthen the forces of freedom \\n        throughout the world''.\\n            (5) Military missions and war planning were contingent upon \\n        the availability of resources and that the United States \\n        Merchant Marine played a vital role in this regard, ensuring \\n        the efficient and reliable transoceanic transport of military \\n        equipment as well as both military and civilian personnel.\\n            (6) The United States Merchant Marine provided for the \\n        successful transport of resources and personnel despite \\n        consistent and ongoing exposure to enemy combatants from both \\n        the air and the sea, such as enemy bomber squadrons, \\n        submarines, and mines.\\n            (7) The efforts of the United States Merchant Marine were \\n        not without sacrifices as they bore a higher per capita \\n        casualty rate than any other branch of the military during the \\n        war.\\n            (8) The United States Merchant Marine proved to be an \\n        instrumental asset on untold occasions, participating in every \\n        landing operation by the United States Marine Corps from \\n        Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima as well as providing, for instance, the \\n        bulk tonnage of material necessary for the invasion of Normandy \\n        which ``would not have been possible without the Merchant \\n        Marine'', as a 1944 New York Times article observed.\\n            (9) In also assessing their performance, General Dwight D. \\n        Eisenhower stated, ``every man in this Allied command is quick \\n        to express his admiration for the loyalty, courage, and \\n        fortitude of the officers and men of the Merchant Marine. We \\n        count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion to duty as \\n        we do our own; they have never failed us''.\\n            (10) During a September 1944 speech, President Franklin D. \\n        Roosevelt stated, the Merchant Marine has ``delivered the goods \\n        when and where needed in every theater of operations and across \\n        every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult, and dangerous \\n        transportation job ever undertaken. As time goes on, there will \\n        be greater public understanding of our merchant fleet's record \\n        during this war.''.\\n            (11) The feats and accomplishments of the Merchant Marine \\n        are deserving of broader public recognition.\\n            (12) The United States will be forever grateful and \\n        indebted to the U.S. Merchant Marine for their effective, \\n        reliable, and courageous transport of goods and resources in \\n        enemy territory throughout theaters of every variety in World \\n        War II; that these goods and resources saved thousands of lives \\n        and enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory in World War II.\\n            (13) The Congressional Gold Medal will be an appropriate \\n        way to shed further light on the service of the Merchant Marine \\n        in World War II and the instrumental role they played in \\n        winning World War II.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

The revised regulation shall declare that a published or distributed investment fund research report shall not be deemed to constitute an offer for sale or an offer to sell a security that is the subject of the offering pursuant to an effective registration statement, even if the broker or dealer is participating or will participate in the registered offering of the covered investment fund's securities. The covered investment fund research report shall indeed be deemed to satisfy the regulation's requirements as well as those of any self-regulatory organization. The SEC shall not impose specified conditions and requirements when implementing the safe harbor.  Until the SEC has adopted such safe harbor revisions, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has revised a related rule, a covered investment fund shall be deemed to be a security listed on a national securities exchange that is not subject to a certain filing requirement of the Investment Company Act of 1940.    \n",

FINDINGS.\\n(a) Findings.--Congress believes that: (1) It is important for the public lands to produce and continue producing water and soil conservation benefits, livestock forage, wildlife forage, and recreational opportunities. (2) The long-term improvement of rangelands can be achieved through cooperative agreements, partnerships, and flexible management programs. (3) To manage renewable resources properly, it is necessary to charge a fee that is fair and reflects the value of the forage provided. (4) The intermingling of public and private land ownership in the western United States creates a strong connection between public and private lands for forage, water, and habitat for wildlife and livestock. (5) Many rural communities and job opportunities in rural America depend on the protection of privately held production units on Federal lands.\\nSEC. 2. ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE REQUIREMENTS.\\nAll grazing operations on Federal lands must follow applicable Federal, State, and local laws, including but not limited to: (1) Animal Damage Control Act. (2) Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. (3) Clean Air Act. (4) Endangered Species Act of 1973. (5) Federal Advisory Committee Act. (6) Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977. (7) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. (8) Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. (9) Federal Water Pollution Control Act. (10) Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. (11) Granger-Thye Act. (12) Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952. (13) Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960. (14) National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. (15) National Forest Management Act of 1976. (16) Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978. (17) Taylor Grazing Act. (18) Wilderness Act.\\nSEC. 3. FEE SCHEDULE.\\n(a) The following terms are used in this section: (1) \"Sixteen Western States\" refers to Washington, California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Oregon, Oklahoma, Arizona, Utah, and Montana. (2) \"AUM\" means an animal unit month. (3) \"Authorized Federal AUMs\" refers to the total number of allotted AUMs and permitted to graze AUMs. (4) \"WAPLLR\" is the weighted average private land lease rate calculated for each year. (5) \"Report\" refers to the report titled \"Grazing Fee Review and Evaluation Update of the 1986 Final Report\".

SHORT TITLE.\\nThis law is called the \"Small Business Tax Modernization Act of 2004\".\\nSEC. 2. UNIFIED PASS-THRU ENTITY REGIME.\\n(a) Termination of S Corporation Status. (1) No new S corporation elections. People cannot choose to become an S corporation after December 31, 2004.\\n(2) Termination of status. After 2014, S corporations will be treated as partnerships for tax purposes.\\n(3) Effective date. These changes will apply to tax years starting after December 31, 2004.\\n(b) Election by Certain Corporations to Be Taxed as Partnership. (1) In general. A corporation can choose to be taxed as a partnership.\\n(2) Tax treatment of S corporation electing unified pass-thru regime. The shareholders of an S corporation that chooses to be taxed as a partnership will be treated as if they received a distribution of the corporation's assets in exchange for their stock. Any gain or loss from this distribution will be spread out over the following five years.\\n(3) Modification to treatment of section 1374 tax for earnings and profits purposes. \\nThis part is talking about changing the way taxes are calculated for a certain type of corporation. It says that the amount of money made from selling assets and any deductions allowed for taxes should not be included when calculating the taxes for this type of corporation. Additionally, the amount of money the corporation has saved up over the years should be increased at the beginning of the year by the amount of money not included in the calculations (minus the taxes already paid).\\nEffect of election on recognition period for purposes of tax imposed on built-in gains.\\nThis part is about how a certain type of tax is applied to corporations. It says that the \"recognition period,\" which is the amount of time the tax applies, is normally 10 years starting from the first year the corporation became a certain type of corporation. But if the corporation chooses to be taxed differently, the recognition period will be 25 years instead. However, if the 10-year period has already passed when the corporation makes the choice, then it will still only be 10 years.\\nStep Transaction Doctrine not to Apply to Partnership Incorporation Followed by Corporate Reorganization.\\nThis part is about a rule that applies when a partnership becomes a corporation and then reorganizes. It says that a certain legal principle called the \"step transaction doctrine\" should not be used to determine if the control requirement is met in this case. It only applies when a partnership transfers most of its assets to a privately owned corporation and then the corporation goes through a reorganization process.\\nPartnership Income Attributable to Capital Excluded from Net Earnings from Self-Employment.\\nThis part is about how income from partnerships is taxed. It says that the income a partner receives from their ownership in a partnership that is considered \"capital income\" should be excluded from the calculation of their self-employment income. Instead, only the income from the partner's services should be considered. The specific definition of \"capital income\" is also given, which includes any excess money the partner has invested in the partnership and a fair rate of return on that investment.\\nA \"reasonable rate of return on unreturned capital\" means that if someone gives money to a business and doesn't get it back, the business should give them 150% of the highest interest rate set by the government at the beginning of the year. The government can also set a higher interest rate if they want.\\nThe government will make rules (called regulations) to make sure this happens.\\nThese rules will start applying to money given to businesses after December 31, 2004.  \n",
              "4  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE\\nThis law is called the \"Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 2016\".\\nSEC. 2. SAFE HARBOR FOR INVESTMENT FUND RESEARCH\\n(a) Expansion of the Safe Harbor The government agency in charge of regulating securities and investments (called the Securities and Exchange Commission) has to make some changes to a specific regulation within 180 days of this law being passed. These changes are meant to protect investors and promote the creation of new investments. The new regulation will say that a report about a specific investment fund, written by a broker or dealer, will not be considered a sale offer or a solicitation for that investment fund's securities, even if the broker is involved in selling those securities. It will also say that the report meets certain conditions set by the Commission's rules and regulations.\\n(b) Implementation of Safe Harbor The government agency will also have to figure out how to enforce this new safe harbor regulation.\\nAccording to this rule (subsection (a)), the Commission is not allowed to make certain conditions for a safe harbor related to a type of investment fund that is continuously distributing securities. They cannot make it a requirement for a broker or dealer to publish or distribute a research report on this investment fund in order to initiate or restart research coverage on the fund or its securities. The Commission also cannot require the investment fund to be registered as an investment company or subject to certain reporting requirements for a longer period of time than what is mentioned in another regulation. They also cannot impose a minimum provision that exceeds what is mentioned in that regulation. Furthermore, a self-regulatory organization cannot have a rule that prevents a member from publishing or distributing a research report on the investment fund solely because the member is participating in a registered offering or distribution of any securities of that investment fund. The organization also cannot prevent a member from participating in a registered offering or distribution of securities of the investment fund solely because the member has published or distributed a research report on that investment fund or its securities. Lastly, a research report on the investment fund is not subject to a specific section of another law and its regulations, except if it does not meet the content standards set by self-regulatory organizations regarding research reports on investment companies or similar standards.\\n(c) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as in any way limiting--\\n(1) the applicability of the antifraud or antimanipulation provisions of the Federal securities laws and rules adopted thereunder to a covered investment fund research report, including section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77q), section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b)), and sections 9 and 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78i, 78j); or\\n(2) the authority of any self-regulatory organization to examine or supervise a member's practices in connection with such member's publication or distribution of a covered investment fund research report for compliance with applicable provisions of the Federal securities laws or self-regulatory organization rules related to research reports, including those contained in rules governing communications with the public.\\n(d) Interim Effectiveness of Safe Harbor.--\\n(1) In general.-- From and after the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, if the Commission has not adopted revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, as required by subsection (a), and until such time as the Commission has done so, a broker or dealer distributing or publishing a covered investment fund research report after such date shall be able to rely on the provisions of section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, and the broker or dealer's publication of such report shall be deemed to satisfy the conditions of.\\nParagraph (a\\n(1) or (a)(2) of that section if the covered investment fund that is the subject of such report satisfies the reporting history requirements (without regard to Form S-3 or Form F-3 eligibility) and minimum float provisions of such subsections for purposes of the Commission's rules and regulations under the Federal securities laws and the rules of any self-regulatory organization, as if revised and implemented in accordance with subsections (a) and (b).\\nTranslation: If the investment fund being talked about in the report meets certain requirements set by the government and other organizations, then paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of that section applies.\\n(2) Status of covered investment fund.--After such period and until the Commission has adopted revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, and FINRA has revised rule 2210, for purposes of subsection (c)(7)(O) of such rule, a covered investment fund shall be deemed to be a security that is listed on a national securities exchange and that is not subject to section 24(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)). Communications concerning only covered investment funds that fall within the scope of such section shall not be required to be filed with FINRA.\\nTranslation: Until certain changes are made by the government and other organizations, a covered investment fund is considered to be a type of investment that is listed on a national exchange and not subject to certain rules. People don't have to submit certain documents to FINRA if they are only talking about these specific investment funds.\\n(e) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\\n(1) The term \"covered investment fund research report\" means a research report published or distributed by a broker or dealer about a covered investment fund or any securities issued by the covered investment fund, but does not include a research report to the extent that the research report is published or distributed by the covered investment fund or any affiliate of the covered investment fund.\\nTranslation: In this law, the term \"covered investment fund research report\" refers to a report made by a broker or dealer about a certain type of investment fund or the securities it issues. However, it doesn't include reports made by the investment fund itself or any of its related companies.\\n(2) The term \"covered investment fund\" means: (A) a company that invests money for people and has registered with the government or chosen to be treated as a special type of company, and has also filed paperwork to sell a type of investment to the public. The government has approved this paperwork; (B) a trust or other organization: (i) that sells investments to the public and has registered with the government, and the investments can be bought and sold on a special market; (ii) whose main assets are things like goods, money from different countries, or special contracts based on goods or money; (iii) that says in its paperwork filed with the government that the investments it sells can be bought or sold, but only under certain conditions.(3) The term \"FINRA\" means the people who make sure that companies in the financial industry follow the rules.\\n(4) The term \"research report\" means a document that gives information about an investment, as defined in a law, but does not include spoken information.\\n(5) The term \"self-regulatory organization\" means a group that makes sure that companies in the investment market follow the rules, as defined in a law.

Eisenhower, acknowledged that ``through the \\n        prompt delivery of supplies and equipment to our armed forces \\n        overseas, and of cargoes representing economic and military aid \\n        to friendly nations, the American Merchant Marine has \\n        effectively helped to strengthen the forces of freedom \\n        throughout the world''.\\n            (5) Military missions and war planning were contingent upon \\n        the availability of resources and that the United States \\n        Merchant Marine played a vital role in this regard, ensuring \\n        the efficient and reliable transoceanic transport of military \\n        equipment as well as both military and civilian personnel.\\n            (6) The United States Merchant Marine provided for the \\n        successful transport of resources and personnel despite \\n        consistent and ongoing exposure to enemy combatants from both \\n        the air and the sea, such as enemy bomber squadrons, \\n        submarines, and mines.\\n            (7) The efforts of the United States Merchant Marine were \\n        not without sacrifices as they bore a higher per capita \\n        casualty rate than any other branch of the military during the \\n        war.\\n            (8) The United States Merchant Marine proved to be an \\n        instrumental asset on untold occasions, participating in every \\n        landing operation by the United States Marine Corps from \\n        Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima as well as providing, for instance, the \\n        bulk tonnage of material necessary for the invasion of Normandy \\n        which ``would not have been possible without the Merchant \\n        Marine'', as a 1944 New York Times article observed.\\n            (9) In also assessing their performance, General Dwight D. \\n        Eisenhower stated, ``every man in this Allied command is quick \\n        to express his admiration for the loyalty, courage, and \\n        fortitude of the officers and men of the Merchant Marine. We \\n        count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion to duty as \\n        we do our own; they have never failed us''.\\n            (10) During a September 1944 speech, President Franklin D. \\n        Roosevelt stated, the Merchant Marine has ``delivered the goods \\n        when and where needed in every theater of operations and across \\n        every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult, and dangerous \\n        transportation job ever undertaken. As time goes on, there will \\n        be greater public understanding of our merchant fleet's record \\n        during this war.''.\\n            (11) The feats and accomplishments of the Merchant Marine \\n        are deserving of broader public recognition.\\n            (12) The United States will be forever grateful and \\n        indebted to the U.S. Merchant Marine for their effective, \\n        reliable, and courageous transport of goods and resources in \\n        enemy territory throughout theaters of every variety in World \\n        War II; that these goods and resources saved thousands of lives \\n        and enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory in World War II.\\n            (13) The Congressional Gold Medal will be an appropriate \\n        way to shed further light on the service of the Merchant Marine \\n        in World War II and the instrumental role they played in \\n        winning World War II.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

UNIFIED PASS-THRU ENTITY REGIME.\\n(a) Termination of S Corporation Status. (1) No new S corporation elections. People cannot choose to become an S corporation after December 31, 2004.\\n(2) Termination of status. After 2014, S corporations will be treated as partnerships for tax purposes.\\n(3) Effective date. These changes will apply to tax years starting after December 31, 2004.\\n(b) Election by Certain Corporations to Be Taxed as Partnership. (1) In general. A corporation can choose to be taxed as a partnership.\\n(2) Tax treatment of S corporation electing unified pass-thru regime. The shareholders of an S corporation that chooses to be taxed as a partnership will be treated as if they received a distribution of the corporation's assets in exchange for their stock. Any gain or loss from this distribution will be spread out over the following five years.\\n(3) Modification to treatment of section 1374 tax for earnings and profits purposes. \\nThis part is talking about changing the way taxes are calculated for a certain type of corporation. It says that the amount of money made from selling assets and any deductions allowed for taxes should not be included when calculating the taxes for this type of corporation. Additionally, the amount of money the corporation has saved up over the years should be increased at the beginning of the year by the amount of money not included in the calculations (minus the taxes already paid).\\nEffect of election on recognition period for purposes of tax imposed on built-in gains.\\nThis part is about how a certain type of tax is applied to corporations. It says that the \"recognition period,\" which is the amount of time the tax applies, is normally 10 years starting from the first year the corporation became a certain type of corporation. But if the corporation chooses to be taxed differently, the recognition period will be 25 years instead. However, if the 10-year period has already passed when the corporation makes the choice, then it will still only be 10 years.\\nStep Transaction Doctrine not to Apply to Partnership Incorporation Followed by Corporate Reorganization.\\nThis part is about a rule that applies when a partnership becomes a corporation and then reorganizes. It says that a certain legal principle called the \"step transaction doctrine\" should not be used to determine if the control requirement is met in this case. It only applies when a partnership transfers most of its assets to a privately owned corporation and then the corporation goes through a reorganization process.\\nPartnership Income Attributable to Capital Excluded from Net Earnings from Self-Employment.\\nThis part is about how income from partnerships is taxed. It says that the income a partner receives from their ownership in a partnership that is considered \"capital income\" should be excluded from the calculation of their self-employment income. Instead, only the income from the partner's services should be considered. The specific definition of \"capital income\" is also given, which includes any excess money the partner has invested in the partnership and a fair rate of return on that investment.\\nA \"reasonable rate of return on unreturned capital\" means that if someone gives money to a business and doesn't get it back, the business should give them 150% of the highest interest rate set by the government at the beginning of the year. The government can also set a higher interest rate if they want.\\nThe government will make rules (called regulations) to make sure this happens.\\nThese rules will start applying to money given to businesses after December 31, 2004.</td>\n",

These changes are meant to protect investors and promote the creation of new investments. The new regulation will say that a report about a specific investment fund, written by a broker or dealer, will not be considered a sale offer or a solicitation for that investment fund's securities, even if the broker is involved in selling those securities. It will also say that the report meets certain conditions set by the Commission's rules and regulations.\\n(b) Implementation of Safe Harbor The government agency will also have to figure out how to enforce this new safe harbor regulation.\\nAccording to this rule (subsection (a)), the Commission is not allowed to make certain conditions for a safe harbor related to a type of investment fund that is continuously distributing securities. They cannot make it a requirement for a broker or dealer to publish or distribute a research report on this investment fund in order to initiate or restart research coverage on the fund or its securities. The Commission also cannot require the investment fund to be registered as an investment company or subject to certain reporting requirements for a longer period of time than what is mentioned in another regulation. They also cannot impose a minimum provision that exceeds what is mentioned in that regulation. Furthermore, a self-regulatory organization cannot have a rule that prevents a member from publishing or distributing a research report on the investment fund solely because the member is participating in a registered offering or distribution of any securities of that investment fund. The organization also cannot prevent a member from participating in a registered offering or distribution of securities of the investment fund solely because the member has published or distributed a research report on that investment fund or its securities. Lastly, a research report on the investment fund is not subject to a specific section of another law and its regulations, except if it does not meet the content standards set by self-regulatory organizations regarding research reports on investment companies or similar standards.\\n(c) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as in any way limiting--\\n(1) the applicability of the antifraud or antimanipulation provisions of the Federal securities laws and rules adopted thereunder to a covered investment fund research report, including section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77q), section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b)), and sections 9 and 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78i, 78j); or\\n(2) the authority of any self-regulatory organization to examine or supervise a member's practices in connection with such member's publication or distribution of a covered investment fund research report for compliance with applicable provisions of the Federal securities laws or self-regulatory organization rules related to research reports, including those contained in rules governing communications with the public.\\n(d) Interim Effectiveness of Safe Harbor.--\\n(1) In general.-- From and after the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, if the Commission has not adopted revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, as required by subsection (a), and until such time as the Commission has done so, a broker or dealer distributing or publishing a covered investment fund research report after such date shall be able to rely on the provisions of section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, and the broker or dealer's publication of such report shall be deemed to satisfy the conditions of.\\nParagraph (a\\n(1) or (a)(2) of that section if the covered investment fund that is the subject of such report satisfies the reporting history requirements (without regard to Form S-3 or Form F-3 eligibility) and minimum float provisions of such subsections for purposes of the Commission's rules and regulations under the Federal securities laws and the rules of any self-regulatory organization, as if revised and implemented in accordance with subsections (a) and (b).\\nTranslation: If the investment fund being talked about in the report meets certain requirements set by the government and other organizations, then paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of that section applies.\\n(2) Status of covered investment fund.--After such period and until the Commission has adopted revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, and FINRA has revised rule 2210, for purposes of subsection (c)(7)(O) of such rule, a covered investment fund shall be deemed to be a security that is listed on a national securities exchange and that is not subject to section 24(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)). Communications concerning only covered investment funds that fall within the scope of such section shall not be required to be filed with FINRA.\\nTranslation: Until certain changes are made by the government and other organizations, a covered investment fund is considered to be a type of investment that is listed on a national exchange and not subject to certain rules. People don't have to submit certain documents to FINRA if they are only talking about these specific investment funds.\\n(e) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\\n(1) The term \"covered investment fund research report\" means a research report published or distributed by a broker or dealer about a covered investment fund or any securities issued by the covered investment fund, but does not include a research report to the extent that the research report is published or distributed by the covered investment fund or any affiliate of the covered investment fund.\\nTranslation: In this law, the term \"covered investment fund research report\" refers to a report made by a broker or dealer about a certain type of investment fund or the securities it issues. However, it doesn't include reports made by the investment fund itself or any of its related companies.\\n(2) The term \"covered investment fund\" means: (A) a company that invests money for people and has registered with the government or chosen to be treated as a special type of company, and has also filed paperwork to sell a type of investment to the public.

FEE SCHEDULE.\\n\\n    (a) For the purpose of this section the terms:\\n            (1) ``Sixteen Western States'' means WA, CA, ID, NV, NM, \\n        WY, CO, KS, SD, ND, NE, OR, OK, AZ, UT and MT.\\n            (2) ``AUM'' means an animal unit month as that term is used \\n        in the Public Rangeland Improvement Act (92 Stat. 1803);\\n            (3) ``Authorized Federal AUMs'' means all ``allotted AUMs'' \\n        reported by BLM and ``permitted to graze AUMs'' reported by \\n        USFS.\\n            (4) ``WAPLLR'' means the weighted average private land \\n        lease rate determined by multiplying the private land lease \\n        rate reported by the Economic Research Service for the previous \\n        calendar year for each of the sixteen Western States by the \\n        total number of authorized Federal AUMs, as defined in section \\n        3(a)(3), in each State for the previous fiscal year, then that \\n        result divided by the total number of authorized Federal AUMs \\n        for the sixteen Western States. These individual State results \\n        are then added together and divided by 16 to yield a weighted \\n        average private land lease rate for that year.\\n            (5) ``Report'' means the report titled ``Grazing Fee Review \\n        and Evaluation Update of the 1986 Final Report'' dated April \\n        30, 1992 and prepared by the Departments of the Interior and \\n        Agriculture.\\n            (6) ``Nonfee cost differential'' means a value calculated \\n        annually by the Secretaries by multiplying the weighted \\n        difference in nonfee costs per AUM between public land and \\n        private land by the Input Cost Index (ICI) determined annually \\n        by the Department of Agriculture. The weighted difference in \\n        nonfee costs is a factor of 0.552 determined by deducting the \\n        private AUM nonfee costs (as outlined on page 58 of the report) \\n        from the public AUM nonfee costs for cattle times 4, added to \\n        the result of deducting private AUM nonfee costs from public \\n        AUM nonfee costs for sheep times 1, then that result divided by \\n        5.''\\n            (7) ``Net production differential'' is the percentage \\n        calculated annually by dividing the cash receipts per cow for \\n        Federal permittee livestock producers by the cash receipts per \\n        cow for western non-Federal livestock producers in the sixteen \\n        Western States as surveyed by the Economic Research Service in \\n        annual cost of production surveys (COPS).\\n            (8) ``PLFVR'' means the private lease forage value ratio \\n        determined by dividing the average of the 1964-1968 base years' \\n        private land lease rate into the forage value portion of the \\n        private land lease rate of $1.78 as determined in the 1966 \\n        western livestock grazing survey.\\n    (b) The Secretaries of the Department of Agriculture and the \\nDepartment of the Interior shall calculate annually the Federal forage \\nfee by calculating the average of the WALLPR for the preceding three \\nyears; multiplying it by the PLFVR; then deducting from that result the \\nnonfee cost differential; and multiplying that result by the net \\nproduction differential. For each year that this calculation is made, \\nall data used for calculating this fee shall come from the calendar \\nyear previous to the year for which the fee is being calculated unless \\nspecified otherwise in the above calculations.\\n    (c) The Federal forage fee shall apply to all authorized Federal \\nAUMs under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of \\nAgriculture and the United States Department of the Interior.\\n    (d) For the first year that the Secretaries calculate the Federal \\nforage fee, the fee shall not be greater than 125 percent, or less than \\n75 percent of the fee calculated for the previous year pursuant to \\nExecutive Order 12548 dated February 14, 1986. For each year after the \\nfirst year that the Secretaries calculate the Federal forage fee, the \\nfee shall not be greater than 125 percent, or less than 75 percent of \\nthe Federal forage fee calculated for the previous year.\\n    (e) The survey of nonfee costs used to calculate the nonfee cost \\ndifferential shall be updated periodically by the Secretaries so as to \\nreflect as accurately as possible the actual nonfee costs incurred by \\nthe cattle and sheep industry that utilizes public lands in the sixteen \\nWestern States. The results of the updated survey shall be incorporated \\ninto the calculation of the Non Fee Cost Differential as they become \\navailable.   \n",

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Merchant Marine of World War II \\nCongressional Gold Medal Act''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    The Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the Allied victory \\n        in World War II and the restoration of peacetime across the \\n        European and Pacific theaters.\\n            (2) The United States Merchant Marine was integral in \\n        providing the link between domestic production and the fighting \\n        forces overseas, providing combat equipment, fuel, food, \\n        commodities, and raw materials to troops stationed overseas.\\n            (3) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowledged the \\n        indispensability of the Merchant Marine to the victory in a \\n        1945 letter stating that without their support, ``the Navy \\n        could not have accomplished its mission''.\\n            (4) President and former Supreme Commander of the Allied \\n        Forces, Dwight D. Eisenhower, acknowledged that ``through the \\n        prompt delivery of supplies and equipment to our armed forces \\n        overseas, and of cargoes representing economic and military aid \\n        to friendly nations, the American Merchant Marine has \\n        effectively helped to strengthen the forces of freedom \\n        throughout the world''.\\n            (5) Military missions and war planning were contingent upon \\n        the availability of resources and that the United States \\n        Merchant Marine played a vital role in this regard, ensuring \\n        the efficient and reliable transoceanic transport of military \\n        equipment as well as both military and civilian personnel.\\n            (6) The United States Merchant Marine provided for the \\n        successful transport of resources and personnel despite \\n        consistent and ongoing exposure to enemy combatants from both \\n        the air and the sea, such as enemy bomber squadrons, \\n        submarines, and mines.\\n            (7) The efforts of the United States Merchant Marine were \\n        not without sacrifices as they bore a higher per capita \\n        casualty rate than any other branch of the military during the \\n        war.\\n            (8) The United States Merchant Marine proved to be an \\n        instrumental asset on untold occasions, participating in every \\n        landing operation by the United States Marine Corps from \\n        Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima as well as providing, for instance, the \\n        bulk tonnage of material necessary for the invasion of Normandy \\n        which ``would not have been possible without the Merchant \\n        Marine'', as a 1944 New York Times article observed.\\n            (9) In also assessing their performance, General Dwight D. \\n        Eisenhower stated, ``every man in this Allied command is quick \\n        to express his admiration for the loyalty, courage, and \\n        fortitude of the officers and men of the Merchant Marine. We \\n        count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion to duty as \\n        we do our own; they have never failed us''.\\n            (10) During a September 1944 speech, President Franklin D. \\n        Roosevelt stated, the Merchant Marine has ``delivered the goods \\n        when and where needed in every theater of operations and across \\n        every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult, and dangerous \\n        transportation job ever undertaken. As time goes on, there will \\n        be greater public understanding of our merchant fleet's record \\n        during this war.''.\\n            (11) The feats and accomplishments of the Merchant Marine \\n        are deserving of broader public recognition.\\n            (12) The United States will be forever grateful and \\n        indebted to the U.S. Merchant Marine for their effective, \\n        reliable, and courageous transport of goods and resources in \\n        enemy territory throughout theaters of every variety in World \\n        War II; that these goods and resources saved thousands of lives \\n        and enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory in World War II.\\n            (13) The Congressional Gold Medal will be an appropriate \\n        way to shed further light on the service of the Merchant Marine \\n        in World War II and the instrumental role they played in \\n        winning World War II.\\n\\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\\n\\n    (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of Representatives \\nand the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate \\narrangements for the award, on behalf of the Congress, of a single gold \\nmedal of appropriate design to the U.S. Merchant Marine of World War \\nII, in recognition of their dedicated and vital service during World \\nWar II.\\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award referred to \\nin subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter referred to \\nas the ``Secretary'') shall strike the gold medal with suitable \\nemblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\\n    (c) American Merchant Marine Museum.--\\n            (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in \\n        honor of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the gold medal shall be \\n        given to the American Merchant Marine Museum, where it will be \\n        available for display as appropriate and available for \\n        research.\\n\\nSEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\\n\\n    Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the \\nSecretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal \\nstruck under section 3, at a price sufficient to cover the costs of the \\nmedals, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and \\noverhead expenses.\\n\\nSEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.\\n\\n    (a) National Medals.--Medals struck pursuant to this Act are \\nnational medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States \\nCode.\\n    (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5134 of title 31, \\nUnited States Code, all medals struck under this Act shall be \\nconsidered to be numismatic items.\\n\\n            Passed the House of Representatives November 30, 2016.\\n\\n            Attest:\\n\\n                                                 KAREN L.

The revised regulation shall declare that a published or distributed investment fund research report shall not be deemed to constitute an offer for sale or an offer to sell a security that is the subject of the offering pursuant to an effective registration statement, even if the broker or dealer is participating or will participate in the registered offering of the covered investment fund's securities. The covered investment fund research report shall indeed be deemed to satisfy the regulation's requirements as well as those of any self-regulatory organization. The SEC shall not impose specified conditions and requirements when implementing the safe harbor.  Until the SEC has adopted such safe harbor revisions, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has revised a related rule, a covered investment fund shall be deemed to be a security listed on a national securities exchange that is not subject to a certain filing requirement of the Investment Company Act of 1940.    \n",

FINDINGS.\\n(a) Findings.--Congress believes that: (1) It is important for the public lands to produce and continue producing water and soil conservation benefits, livestock forage, wildlife forage, and recreational opportunities. (2) The long-term improvement of rangelands can be achieved through cooperative agreements, partnerships, and flexible management programs. (3) To manage renewable resources properly, it is necessary to charge a fee that is fair and reflects the value of the forage provided. (4) The intermingling of public and private land ownership in the western United States creates a strong connection between public and private lands for forage, water, and habitat for wildlife and livestock. (5) Many rural communities and job opportunities in rural America depend on the protection of privately held production units on Federal lands.\\nSEC. 2. ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE REQUIREMENTS.\\nAll grazing operations on Federal lands must follow applicable Federal, State, and local laws, including but not limited to: (1) Animal Damage Control Act. (2) Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. (3) Clean Air Act. (4) Endangered Species Act of 1973. (5) Federal Advisory Committee Act. (6) Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977. (7) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. (8) Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. (9) Federal Water Pollution Control Act. (10) Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. (11) Granger-Thye Act. (12) Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952. (13) Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960. (14) National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. (15) National Forest Management Act of 1976. (16) Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978. (17) Taylor Grazing Act. (18) Wilderness Act.\\nSEC. 3. FEE SCHEDULE.\\n(a) The following terms are used in this section: (1) \"Sixteen Western States\" refers to Washington, California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Oregon, Oklahoma, Arizona, Utah, and Montana. (2) \"AUM\" means an animal unit month. (3) \"Authorized Federal AUMs\" refers to the total number of allotted AUMs and permitted to graze AUMs. (4) \"WAPLLR\" is the weighted average private land lease rate calculated for each year. (5) \"Report\" refers to the report titled \"Grazing Fee Review and Evaluation Update of the 1986 Final Report\".

SHORT TITLE.\\nThis law is called the \"Small Business Tax Modernization Act of 2004\".\\nSEC. 2. UNIFIED PASS-THRU ENTITY REGIME.\\n(a) Termination of S Corporation Status. (1) No new S corporation elections. People cannot choose to become an S corporation after December 31, 2004.\\n(2) Termination of status. After 2014, S corporations will be treated as partnerships for tax purposes.\\n(3) Effective date. These changes will apply to tax years starting after December 31, 2004.\\n(b) Election by Certain Corporations to Be Taxed as Partnership. (1) In general. A corporation can choose to be taxed as a partnership.\\n(2) Tax treatment of S corporation electing unified pass-thru regime. The shareholders of an S corporation that chooses to be taxed as a partnership will be treated as if they received a distribution of the corporation's assets in exchange for their stock. Any gain or loss from this distribution will be spread out over the following five years.\\n(3) Modification to treatment of section 1374 tax for earnings and profits purposes. \\nThis part is talking about changing the way taxes are calculated for a certain type of corporation. It says that the amount of money made from selling assets and any deductions allowed for taxes should not be included when calculating the taxes for this type of corporation. Additionally, the amount of money the corporation has saved up over the years should be increased at the beginning of the year by the amount of money not included in the calculations (minus the taxes already paid).\\nEffect of election on recognition period for purposes of tax imposed on built-in gains.\\nThis part is about how a certain type of tax is applied to corporations. It says that the \"recognition period,\" which is the amount of time the tax applies, is normally 10 years starting from the first year the corporation became a certain type of corporation. But if the corporation chooses to be taxed differently, the recognition period will be 25 years instead. However, if the 10-year period has already passed when the corporation makes the choice, then it will still only be 10 years.\\nStep Transaction Doctrine not to Apply to Partnership Incorporation Followed by Corporate Reorganization.\\nThis part is about a rule that applies when a partnership becomes a corporation and then reorganizes. It says that a certain legal principle called the \"step transaction doctrine\" should not be used to determine if the control requirement is met in this case. It only applies when a partnership transfers most of its assets to a privately owned corporation and then the corporation goes through a reorganization process.\\nPartnership Income Attributable to Capital Excluded from Net Earnings from Self-Employment.\\nThis part is about how income from partnerships is taxed. It says that the income a partner receives from their ownership in a partnership that is considered \"capital income\" should be excluded from the calculation of their self-employment income. Instead, only the income from the partner's services should be considered. The specific definition of \"capital income\" is also given, which includes any excess money the partner has invested in the partnership and a fair rate of return on that investment.\\nA \"reasonable rate of return on unreturned capital\" means that if someone gives money to a business and doesn't get it back, the business should give them 150% of the highest interest rate set by the government at the beginning of the year. The government can also set a higher interest rate if they want.\\nThe government will make rules (called regulations) to make sure this happens.\\nThese rules will start applying to money given to businesses after December 31, 2004.   \n",
              "4  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE\\nThis law is called the \"Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 2016\".\\nSEC. 2. SAFE HARBOR FOR INVESTMENT FUND RESEARCH\\n(a) Expansion of the Safe Harbor The government agency in charge of regulating securities and investments (called the Securities and Exchange Commission) has to make some changes to a specific regulation within 180 days of this law being passed. These changes are meant to protect investors and promote the creation of new investments. The new regulation will say that a report about a specific investment fund, written by a broker or dealer, will not be considered a sale offer or a solicitation for that investment fund's securities, even if the broker is involved in selling those securities. It will also say that the report meets certain conditions set by the Commission's rules and regulations.\\n(b) Implementation of Safe Harbor The government agency will also have to figure out how to enforce this new safe harbor regulation.\\nAccording to this rule (subsection (a)), the Commission is not allowed to make certain conditions for a safe harbor related to a type of investment fund that is continuously distributing securities. They cannot make it a requirement for a broker or dealer to publish or distribute a research report on this investment fund in order to initiate or restart research coverage on the fund or its securities. The Commission also cannot require the investment fund to be registered as an investment company or subject to certain reporting requirements for a longer period of time than what is mentioned in another regulation. They also cannot impose a minimum provision that exceeds what is mentioned in that regulation. Furthermore, a self-regulatory organization cannot have a rule that prevents a member from publishing or distributing a research report on the investment fund solely because the member is participating in a registered offering or distribution of any securities of that investment fund. The organization also cannot prevent a member from participating in a registered offering or distribution of securities of the investment fund solely because the member has published or distributed a research report on that investment fund or its securities. Lastly, a research report on the investment fund is not subject to a specific section of another law and its regulations, except if it does not meet the content standards set by self-regulatory organizations regarding research reports on investment companies or similar standards.\\n(c) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as in any way limiting--\\n(1) the applicability of the antifraud or antimanipulation provisions of the Federal securities laws and rules adopted thereunder to a covered investment fund research report, including section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77q), section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b)), and sections 9 and 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78i, 78j); or\\n(2) the authority of any self-regulatory organization to examine or supervise a member's practices in connection with such member's publication or distribution of a covered investment fund research report for compliance with applicable provisions of the Federal securities laws or self-regulatory organization rules related to research reports, including those contained in rules governing communications with the public.\\n(d) Interim Effectiveness of Safe Harbor.--\\n(1) In general.-- From and after the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, if the Commission has not adopted revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, as required by subsection (a), and until such time as the Commission has done so, a broker or dealer distributing or publishing a covered investment fund research report after such date shall be able to rely on the provisions of section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, and the broker or dealer's publication of such report shall be deemed to satisfy the conditions of.\\nParagraph (a\\n(1) or (a)(2) of that section if the covered investment fund that is the subject of such report satisfies the reporting history requirements (without regard to Form S-3 or Form F-3 eligibility) and minimum float provisions of such subsections for purposes of the Commission's rules and regulations under the Federal securities laws and the rules of any self-regulatory organization, as if revised and implemented in accordance with subsections (a) and (b).\\nTranslation: If the investment fund being talked about in the report meets certain requirements set by the government and other organizations, then paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of that section applies.\\n(2) Status of covered investment fund.--After such period and until the Commission has adopted revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, and FINRA has revised rule 2210, for purposes of subsection (c)(7)(O) of such rule, a covered investment fund shall be deemed to be a security that is listed on a national securities exchange and that is not subject to section 24(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)). Communications concerning only covered investment funds that fall within the scope of such section shall not be required to be filed with FINRA.\\nTranslation: Until certain changes are made by the government and other organizations, a covered investment fund is considered to be a type of investment that is listed on a national exchange and not subject to certain rules. People don't have to submit certain documents to FINRA if they are only talking about these specific investment funds.\\n(e) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\\n(1) The term \"covered investment fund research report\" means a research report published or distributed by a broker or dealer about a covered investment fund or any securities issued by the covered investment fund, but does not include a research report to the extent that the research report is published or distributed by the covered investment fund or any affiliate of the covered investment fund.\\nTranslation: In this law, the term \"covered investment fund research report\" refers to a report made by a broker or dealer about a certain type of investment fund or the securities it issues. However, it doesn't include reports made by the investment fund itself or any of its related companies.\\n(2) The term \"covered investment fund\" means: (A) a company that invests money for people and has registered with the government or chosen to be treated as a special type of company, and has also filed paperwork to sell a type of investment to the public.

King acknowledged the \\n        indispensability of the Merchant Marine to the victory in a \\n        1945 letter stating that without their support, ``the Navy \\n        could not have accomplished its mission''.\\n            (4) President and former Supreme Commander of the Allied \\n        Forces, Dwight D. Eisenhower, acknowledged that ``through the \\n        prompt delivery of supplies and equipment to our armed forces \\n        overseas, and of cargoes representing economic and military aid \\n        to friendly nations, the American Merchant Marine has \\n        effectively helped to strengthen the forces of freedom \\n        throughout the world''.\\n            (5) Military missions and war planning were contingent upon \\n        the availability of resources and that the United States \\n        Merchant Marine played a vital role in this regard, ensuring \\n        the efficient and reliable transoceanic transport of military \\n        equipment as well as both military and civilian personnel.\\n            (6) The United States Merchant Marine provided for the \\n        successful transport of resources and personnel despite \\n        consistent and ongoing exposure to enemy combatants from both \\n        the air and the sea, such as enemy bomber squadrons, \\n        submarines, and mines.\\n            (7) The efforts of the United States Merchant Marine were \\n        not without sacrifices as they bore a higher per capita \\n        casualty rate than any other branch of the military during the \\n        war.\\n            (8) The United States Merchant Marine proved to be an \\n        instrumental asset on untold occasions, participating in every \\n        landing operation by the United States Marine Corps from \\n        Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima as well as providing, for instance, the \\n        bulk tonnage of material necessary for the invasion of Normandy \\n        which ``would not have been possible without the Merchant \\n        Marine'', as a 1944 New York Times article observed.\\n            (9) In also assessing their performance, General Dwight D. \\n        Eisenhower stated, ``every man in this Allied command is quick \\n        to express his admiration for the loyalty, courage, and \\n        fortitude of the officers and men of the Merchant Marine. We \\n        count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion to duty as \\n        we do our own; they have never failed us''.\\n            (10) During a September 1944 speech, President Franklin D. \\n        Roosevelt stated, the Merchant Marine has ``delivered the goods \\n        when and where needed in every theater of operations and across \\n        every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult, and dangerous \\n        transportation job ever undertaken. As time goes on, there will \\n        be greater public understanding of our merchant fleet's record \\n        during this war.''.\\n            (11) The feats and accomplishments of the Merchant Marine \\n        are deserving of broader public recognition.\\n            (12) The United States will be forever grateful and \\n        indebted to the U.S. Merchant Marine for their effective, \\n        reliable, and courageous transport of goods and resources in \\n        enemy territory throughout theaters of every variety in World \\n        War II; that these goods and resources saved thousands of lives \\n        and enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory in World War II.\\n            (13) The Congressional Gold Medal will be an appropriate \\n        way to shed further light on the service of the Merchant Marine \\n        in World War II and the instrumental role they played in \\n        winning World War II.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

              "      <td>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\\nThis law is called the \"Small Business Tax Modernization Act of 2004\".\\nSEC. 2. UNIFIED PASS-THRU ENTITY REGIME.\\n(a) Termination of S Corporation Status. (1) No new S corporation elections. People cannot choose to become an S corporation after December 31, 2004.\\n(2) Termination of status. After 2014, S corporations will be treated as partnerships for tax purposes.\\n(3) Effective date. These changes will apply to tax years starting after December 31, 2004.\\n(b) Election by Certain Corporations to Be Taxed as Partnership. (1) In general. A corporation can choose to be taxed as a partnership.\\n(2) Tax treatment of S corporation electing unified pass-thru regime. The shareholders of an S corporation that chooses to be taxed as a partnership will be treated as if they received a distribution of the corporation's assets in exchange for their stock. Any gain or loss from this distribution will be spread out over the following five years.\\n(3) Modification to treatment of section 1374 tax for earnings and profits purposes. \\nThis part is talking about changing the way taxes are calculated for a certain type of corporation. It says that the amount of money made from selling assets and any deductions allowed for taxes should not be included when calculating the taxes for this type of corporation. Additionally, the amount of money the corporation has saved up over the years should be increased at the beginning of the year by the amount of money not included in the calculations (minus the taxes already paid).\\nEffect of election on recognition period for purposes of tax imposed on built-in gains.\\nThis part is about how a certain type of tax is applied to corporations. It says that the \"recognition period,\" which is the amount of time the tax applies, is normally 10 years starting from the first year the corporation became a certain type of corporation. But if the corporation chooses to be taxed differently, the recognition period will be 25 years instead. However, if the 10-year period has already passed when the corporation makes the choice, then it will still only be 10 years.\\nStep Transaction Doctrine not to Apply to Partnership Incorporation Followed by Corporate Reorganization.\\nThis part is about a rule that applies when a partnership becomes a corporation and then reorganizes. It says that a certain legal principle called the \"step transaction doctrine\" should not be used to determine if the control requirement is met in this case. It only applies when a partnership transfers most of its assets to a privately owned corporation and then the corporation goes through a reorganization process.\\nPartnership Income Attributable to Capital Excluded from Net Earnings from Self-Employment.\\nThis part is about how income from partnerships is taxed. It says that the income a partner receives from their ownership in a partnership that is considered \"capital income\" should be excluded from the calculation of their self-employment income. Instead, only the income from the partner's services should be considered. The specific definition of \"capital income\" is also given, which includes any excess money the partner has invested in the partnership and a fair rate of return on that investment.\\nA \"reasonable rate of return on unreturned capital\" means that if someone gives money to a business and doesn't get it back, the business should give them 150% of the highest interest rate set by the government at the beginning of the year. The government can also set a higher interest rate if they want.\\nThe government will make rules (called regulations) to make sure this happens.\\nThese rules will start applying to money given to businesses after December 31, 2004.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 2016 This bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revise a specified regulation to create a safe harbor for certain publications or distributions of research reports by brokers or dealers distributing securities. The revised regulation shall declare that a published or distributed investment fund research report shall not be deemed to constitute an offer for sale or an offer to sell a security that is the subject of the offering pursuant to an effective registration statement, even if the broker or dealer is participating or will participate in the registered offering of the covered investment fund's securities. The covered investment fund research report shall indeed be deemed to satisfy the regulation's requirements as well as those of any self-regulatory organization. The SEC shall not impose specified conditions and requirements when implementing the safe harbor.  Until the SEC has adopted such safe harbor revisions, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has revised a related rule, a covered investment fund shall be deemed to be a security listed on a national securities exchange that is not subject to a certain filing requirement of the Investment Company Act of 1940.</td>\n",

              "      <td>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE\\nThis law is called the \"Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 2016\".\\nSEC. 2. SAFE HARBOR FOR INVESTMENT FUND RESEARCH\\n(a) Expansion of the Safe Harbor The government agency in charge of regulating securities and investments (called the Securities and Exchange Commission) has to make some changes to a specific regulation within 180 days of this law being passed. These changes are meant to protect investors and promote the creation of new investments. The new regulation will say that a report about a specific investment fund, written by a broker or dealer, will not be considered a sale offer or a solicitation for that investment fund's securities, even if the broker is involved in selling those securities. It will also say that the report meets certain conditions set by the Commission's rules and regulations.\\n(b) Implementation of Safe Harbor The government agency will also have to figure out how to enforce this new safe harbor regulation.\\nAccording to this rule (subsection (a)), the Commission is not allowed to make certain conditions for a safe harbor related to a type of investment fund that is continuously distributing securities. They cannot make it a requirement for a broker or dealer to publish or distribute a research report on this investment fund in order to initiate or restart research coverage on the fund or its securities. The Commission also cannot require the investment fund to be registered as an investment company or subject to certain reporting requirements for a longer period of time than what is mentioned in another regulation. They also cannot impose a minimum provision that exceeds what is mentioned in that regulation. Furthermore, a self-regulatory organization cannot have a rule that prevents a member from publishing or distributing a research report on the investment fund solely because the member is participating in a registered offering or distribution of any securities of that investment fund. The organization also cannot prevent a member from participating in a registered offering or distribution of securities of the investment fund solely because the member has published or distributed a research report on that investment fund or its securities. Lastly, a research report on the investment fund is not subject to a specific section of another law and its regulations, except if it does not meet the content standards set by self-regulatory organizations regarding research reports on investment companies or similar standards.\\n(c) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as in any way limiting--\\n(1) the applicability of the antifraud or antimanipulation provisions of the Federal securities laws and rules adopted thereunder to a covered investment fund research report, including section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77q), section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b)), and sections 9 and 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78i, 78j); or\\n(2) the authority of any self-regulatory organization to examine or supervise a member's practices in connection with such member's publication or distribution of a covered investment fund research report for compliance with applicable provisions of the Federal securities laws or self-regulatory organization rules related to research reports, including those contained in rules governing communications with the public.\\n(d) Interim Effectiveness of Safe Harbor.--\\n(1) In general.-- From and after the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, if the Commission has not adopted revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, as required by subsection (a), and until such time as the Commission has done so, a broker or dealer distributing or publishing a covered investment fund research report after such date shall be able to rely on the provisions of section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, and the broker or dealer's publication of such report shall be deemed to satisfy the conditions of.\\nParagraph (a\\n(1) or (a)(2) of that section if the covered investment fund that is the subject of such report satisfies the reporting history requirements (without regard to Form S-3 or Form F-3 eligibility) and minimum float provisions of such subsections for purposes of the Commission's rules and regulations under the Federal securities laws and the rules of any self-regulatory organization, as if revised and implemented in accordance with subsections (a) and (b).\\nTranslation: If the investment fund being talked about in the report meets certain requirements set by the government and other organizations, then paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of that section applies.\\n(2) Status of covered investment fund.--After such period and until the Commission has adopted revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, and FINRA has revised rule 2210, for purposes of subsection (c)(7)(O) of such rule, a covered investment fund shall be deemed to be a security that is listed on a national securities exchange and that is not subject to section 24(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)). Communications concerning only covered investment funds that fall within the scope of such section shall not be required to be filed with FINRA.\\nTranslation: Until certain changes are made by the government and other organizations, a covered investment fund is considered to be a type of investment that is listed on a national exchange and not subject to certain rules. People don't have to submit certain documents to FINRA if they are only talking about these specific investment funds.\\n(e) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\\n(1) The term \"covered investment fund research report\" means a research report published or distributed by a broker or dealer about a covered investment fund or any securities issued by the covered investment fund, but does not include a research report to the extent that the research report is published or distributed by the covered investment fund or any affiliate of the covered investment fund.\\nTranslation: In this law, the term \"covered investment fund research report\" refers to a report made by a broker or dealer about a certain type of investment fund or the securities it issues. However, it doesn't include reports made by the investment fund itself or any of its related companies.\\n(2) The term \"covered investment fund\" means: (A) a company that invests money for people and has registered with the government or chosen to be treated as a special type of company, and has also filed paperwork to sell a type of investment to the public. The government has approved this paperwork; (B) a trust or other organization: (i) that sells investments to the public and has registered with the government, and the investments can be bought and sold on a special market; (ii) whose main assets are things like goods, money from different countries, or special contracts based on goods or money; (iii) that says in its paperwork filed with the government that the investments it sells can be bought or sold, but only under certain conditions.(3) The term \"FINRA\" means the people who make sure that companies in the financial industry follow the rules.\\n(4) The term \"research report\" means a document that gives information about an investment, as defined in a law, but does not include spoken information.\\n(5) The term \"self-regulatory organization\" means a group that makes sure that companies in the investment market follow the rules, as defined in a law.</td>\n",

FINDINGS.\\n\\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--\\n            (1) it is in the national interest that the public lands \\n        are producing and continue to produce water and soil \\n        conservation benefits, livestock forage, wildlife forage and \\n        recreation and other multiple use opportunities;\\n            (2) rangelands will continue to be stabilized and improved \\n        long term by providing for cooperative agreements, private, \\n        public partnerships and flexibility in management programs and \\n        agreements;\\n            (3) to assure sound management and stewardship of the \\n        renewable resources it is imperative to charge a fee that is \\n        reasonable and equitable and represents the fair value of the \\n        forage provided;\\n            (4) the intermingled private-public land ownership patterns \\n        prevailing in much of the west create a strong interdependence \\n        between public and private lands for forage, water, and habitat \\n        for both wildlife and livestock;\\n            (5) the social and economic infrastructure of many rural \\n        communities and stability of job opportunities in many areas of \\n        rural America are highly independent on the protection of the \\n        value of privately held production units on Federal lands.\\n\\nSEC. 2.

FEE SCHEDULE.\\n\\n    (a) For the purpose of this section the terms:\\n            (1) ``Sixteen Western States'' means WA, CA, ID, NV, NM, \\n        WY, CO, KS, SD, ND, NE, OR, OK, AZ, UT and MT.\\n            (2) ``AUM'' means an animal unit month as that term is used \\n        in the Public Rangeland Improvement Act (92 Stat. 1803);\\n            (3) ``Authorized Federal AUMs'' means all ``allotted AUMs'' \\n        reported by BLM and ``permitted to graze AUMs'' reported by \\n        USFS.\\n            (4) ``WAPLLR'' means the weighted average private land \\n        lease rate determined by multiplying the private land lease \\n        rate reported by the Economic Research Service for the previous \\n        calendar year for each of the sixteen Western States by the \\n        total number of authorized Federal AUMs, as defined in section \\n        3(a)(3), in each State for the previous fiscal year, then that \\n        result divided by the total number of authorized Federal AUMs \\n        for the sixteen Western States. These individual State results \\n        are then added together and divided by 16 to yield a weighted \\n        average private land lease rate for that year.\\n            (5) ``Report'' means the report titled ``Grazing Fee Review \\n        and Evaluation Update of the 1986 Final Report'' dated April \\n        30, 1992 and prepared by the Departments of the Interior and \\n        Agriculture.\\n            (6) ``Nonfee cost differential'' means a value calculated \\n        annually by the Secretaries by multiplying the weighted \\n        difference in nonfee costs per AUM between public land and \\n        private land by the Input Cost Index (ICI) determined annually \\n        by the Department of Agriculture. The weighted difference in \\n        nonfee costs is a factor of 0.552 determined by deducting the \\n        private AUM nonfee costs (as outlined on page 58 of the report) \\n        from the public AUM nonfee costs for cattle times 4, added to \\n        the result of deducting private AUM nonfee costs from public \\n        AUM nonfee costs for sheep times 1, then that result divided by \\n        5.''\\n            (7) ``Net production differential'' is the percentage \\n        calculated annually by dividing the cash receipts per cow for \\n        Federal permittee livestock producers by the cash receipts per \\n        cow for western non-Federal livestock producers in the sixteen \\n        Western States as surveyed by the Economic Research Service in \\n        annual cost of production surveys (COPS).\\n            (8) ``PLFVR'' means the private lease forage value ratio \\n        determined by dividing the average of the 1964-1968 base years' \\n        private land lease rate into the forage value portion of the \\n        private land lease rate of $1.78 as determined in the 1966 \\n        western livestock grazing survey.\\n    (b) The Secretaries of the Department of Agriculture and the \\nDepartment of the Interior shall calculate annually the Federal forage \\nfee by calculating the average of the WALLPR for the preceding three \\nyears; multiplying it by the PLFVR; then deducting from that result the \\nnonfee cost differential; and multiplying that result by the net \\nproduction differential. For each year that this calculation is made, \\nall data used for calculating this fee shall come from the calendar \\nyear previous to the year for which the fee is being calculated unless \\nspecified otherwise in the above calculations.\\n    (c) The Federal forage fee shall apply to all authorized Federal \\nAUMs under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of \\nAgriculture and the United States Department of the Interior.\\n    (d) For the first year that the Secretaries calculate the Federal \\nforage fee, the fee shall not be greater than 125 percent, or less than \\n75 percent of the fee calculated for the previous year pursuant to \\nExecutive Order 12548 dated February 14, 1986. For each year after the \\nfirst year that the Secretaries calculate the Federal forage fee, the \\nfee shall not be greater than 125 percent, or less than 75 percent of \\nthe Federal forage fee calculated for the previous year.\\n    (e) The survey of nonfee costs used to calculate the nonfee cost \\ndifferential shall be updated periodically by the Secretaries so as to \\nreflect as accurately as possible the actual nonfee costs incurred by \\nthe cattle and sheep industry that utilizes public lands in the sixteen \\nWestern States. The results of the updated survey shall be incorporated \\ninto the calculation of the Non Fee Cost Differential as they become \\navailable.   \n",

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Merchant Marine of World War II \\nCongressional Gold Medal Act''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    The Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the Allied victory \\n        in World War II and the restoration of peacetime across the \\n        European and Pacific theaters.\\n            (2) The United States Merchant Marine was integral in \\n        providing the link between domestic production and the fighting \\n        forces overseas, providing combat equipment, fuel, food, \\n        commodities, and raw materials to troops stationed overseas.\\n            (3) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowledged the \\n        indispensability of the Merchant Marine to the victory in a \\n        1945 letter stating that without their support, ``the Navy \\n        could not have accomplished its mission''.\\n            (4) President and former Supreme Commander of the Allied \\n        Forces, Dwight D. Eisenhower, acknowledged that ``through the \\n        prompt delivery of supplies and equipment to our armed forces \\n        overseas, and of cargoes representing economic and military aid \\n        to friendly nations, the American Merchant Marine has \\n        effectively helped to strengthen the forces of freedom \\n        throughout the world''.\\n            (5) Military missions and war planning were contingent upon \\n        the availability of resources and that the United States \\n        Merchant Marine played a vital role in this regard, ensuring \\n        the efficient and reliable transoceanic transport of military \\n        equipment as well as both military and civilian personnel.\\n            (6) The United States Merchant Marine provided for the \\n        successful transport of resources and personnel despite \\n        consistent and ongoing exposure to enemy combatants from both \\n        the air and the sea, such as enemy bomber squadrons, \\n        submarines, and mines.\\n            (7) The efforts of the United States Merchant Marine were \\n        not without sacrifices as they bore a higher per capita \\n        casualty rate than any other branch of the military during the \\n        war.\\n            (8) The United States Merchant Marine proved to be an \\n        instrumental asset on untold occasions, participating in every \\n        landing operation by the United States Marine Corps from \\n        Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima as well as providing, for instance, the \\n        bulk tonnage of material necessary for the invasion of Normandy \\n        which ``would not have been possible without the Merchant \\n        Marine'', as a 1944 New York Times article observed.\\n            (9) In also assessing their performance, General Dwight D. \\n        Eisenhower stated, ``every man in this Allied command is quick \\n        to express his admiration for the loyalty, courage, and \\n        fortitude of the officers and men of the Merchant Marine. We \\n        count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion to duty as \\n        we do our own; they have never failed us''.\\n            (10) During a September 1944 speech, President Franklin D. \\n        Roosevelt stated, the Merchant Marine has ``delivered the goods \\n        when and where needed in every theater of operations and across \\n        every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult, and dangerous \\n        transportation job ever undertaken. As time goes on, there will \\n        be greater public understanding of our merchant fleet's record \\n        during this war.''.\\n            (11) The feats and accomplishments of the Merchant Marine \\n        are deserving of broader public recognition.\\n            (12) The United States will be forever grateful and \\n        indebted to the U.S. Merchant Marine for their effective, \\n        reliable, and courageous transport of goods and resources in \\n        enemy territory throughout theaters of every variety in World \\n        War II; that these goods and resources saved thousands of lives \\n        and enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory in World War II.\\n            (13) The Congressional Gold Medal will be an appropriate \\n        way to shed further light on the service of the Merchant Marine \\n        in World War II and the instrumental role they played in \\n        winning World War II.\\n\\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\\n\\n    (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of Representatives \\nand the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate \\narrangements for the award, on behalf of the Congress, of a single gold \\nmedal of appropriate design to the U.S. Merchant Marine of World War \\nII, in recognition of their dedicated and vital service during World \\nWar II.\\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award referred to \\nin subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter referred to \\nas the ``Secretary'') shall strike the gold medal with suitable \\nemblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\\n    (c) American Merchant Marine Museum.--\\n            (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in \\n        honor of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the gold medal shall be \\n        given to the American Merchant Marine Museum, where it will be \\n        available for display as appropriate and available for \\n        research.\\n\\nSEC. 4.

The revised regulation shall declare that a published or distributed investment fund research report shall not be deemed to constitute an offer for sale or an offer to sell a security that is the subject of the offering pursuant to an effective registration statement, even if the broker or dealer is participating or will participate in the registered offering of the covered investment fund's securities. The covered investment fund research report shall indeed be deemed to satisfy the regulation's requirements as well as those of any self-regulatory organization. The SEC shall not impose specified conditions and requirements when implementing the safe harbor.  Until the SEC has adopted such safe harbor revisions, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has revised a related rule, a covered investment fund shall be deemed to be a security listed on a national securities exchange that is not subject to a certain filing requirement of the Investment Company Act of 1940.    \n",

FINDINGS.\\n(a) Findings.--Congress believes that: (1) It is important for the public lands to produce and continue producing water and soil conservation benefits, livestock forage, wildlife forage, and recreational opportunities. (2) The long-term improvement of rangelands can be achieved through cooperative agreements, partnerships, and flexible management programs. (3) To manage renewable resources properly, it is necessary to charge a fee that is fair and reflects the value of the forage provided. (4) The intermingling of public and private land ownership in the western United States creates a strong connection between public and private lands for forage, water, and habitat for wildlife and livestock. (5) Many rural communities and job opportunities in rural America depend on the protection of privately held production units on Federal lands.\\nSEC. 2. ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE REQUIREMENTS.\\nAll grazing operations on Federal lands must follow applicable Federal, State, and local laws, including but not limited to: (1) Animal Damage Control Act. (2) Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. (3) Clean Air Act. (4) Endangered Species Act of 1973. (5) Federal Advisory Committee Act. (6) Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977. (7) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. (8) Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. (9) Federal Water Pollution Control Act. (10) Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. (11) Granger-Thye Act. (12) Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952. (13) Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960. (14) National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. (15) National Forest Management Act of 1976. (16) Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978. (17) Taylor Grazing Act. (18) Wilderness Act.\\nSEC. 3. FEE SCHEDULE.\\n(a) The following terms are used in this section: (1) \"Sixteen Western States\" refers to Washington, California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Oregon, Oklahoma, Arizona, Utah, and Montana. (2) \"AUM\" means an animal unit month. (3) \"Authorized Federal AUMs\" refers to the total number of allotted AUMs and permitted to graze AUMs. (4) \"WAPLLR\" is the weighted average private land lease rate calculated for each year. (5) \"Report\" refers to the report titled \"Grazing Fee Review and Evaluation Update of the 1986 Final Report\".

SHORT TITLE.\\nThis law is called the \"Small Business Tax Modernization Act of 2004\".\\nSEC. 2. UNIFIED PASS-THRU ENTITY REGIME.\\n(a) Termination of S Corporation Status. (1) No new S corporation elections. People cannot choose to become an S corporation after December 31, 2004.\\n(2) Termination of status. After 2014, S corporations will be treated as partnerships for tax purposes.\\n(3) Effective date. These changes will apply to tax years starting after December 31, 2004.\\n(b) Election by Certain Corporations to Be Taxed as Partnership. (1) In general. A corporation can choose to be taxed as a partnership.\\n(2) Tax treatment of S corporation electing unified pass-thru regime. The shareholders of an S corporation that chooses to be taxed as a partnership will be treated as if they received a distribution of the corporation's assets in exchange for their stock. Any gain or loss from this distribution will be spread out over the following five years.\\n(3) Modification to treatment of section 1374 tax for earnings and profits purposes. \\nThis part is talking about changing the way taxes are calculated for a certain type of corporation. It says that the amount of money made from selling assets and any deductions allowed for taxes should not be included when calculating the taxes for this type of corporation. Additionally, the amount of money the corporation has saved up over the years should be increased at the beginning of the year by the amount of money not included in the calculations (minus the taxes already paid).\\nEffect of election on recognition period for purposes of tax imposed on built-in gains.\\nThis part is about how a certain type of tax is applied to corporations. It says that the \"recognition period,\" which is the amount of time the tax applies, is normally 10 years starting from the first year the corporation became a certain type of corporation. But if the corporation chooses to be taxed differently, the recognition period will be 25 years instead. However, if the 10-year period has already passed when the corporation makes the choice, then it will still only be 10 years.\\nStep Transaction Doctrine not to Apply to Partnership Incorporation Followed by Corporate Reorganization.\\nThis part is about a rule that applies when a partnership becomes a corporation and then reorganizes. It says that a certain legal principle called the \"step transaction doctrine\" should not be used to determine if the control requirement is met in this case. It only applies when a partnership transfers most of its assets to a privately owned corporation and then the corporation goes through a reorganization process.\\nPartnership Income Attributable to Capital Excluded from Net Earnings from Self-Employment.\\nThis part is about how income from partnerships is taxed. It says that the income a partner receives from their ownership in a partnership that is considered \"capital income\" should be excluded from the calculation of their self-employment income. Instead, only the income from the partner's services should be considered. The specific definition of \"capital income\" is also given, which includes any excess money the partner has invested in the partnership and a fair rate of return on that investment.\\nA \"reasonable rate of return on unreturned capital\" means that if someone gives money to a business and doesn't get it back, the business should give them 150% of the highest interest rate set by the government at the beginning of the year. The government can also set a higher interest rate if they want.\\nThe government will make rules (called regulations) to make sure this happens.\\nThese rules will start applying to money given to businesses after December 31, 2004.   \n",
              "4  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE\\nThis law is called the \"Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 2016\".\\nSEC. 2. SAFE HARBOR FOR INVESTMENT FUND RESEARCH\\n(a) Expansion of the Safe Harbor The government agency in charge of regulating securities and investments (called the Securities and Exchange Commission) has to make some changes to a specific regulation within 180 days of this law being passed. These changes are meant to protect investors and promote the creation of new investments. The new regulation will say that a report about a specific investment fund, written by a broker or dealer, will not be considered a sale offer or a solicitation for that investment fund's securities, even if the broker is involved in selling those securities. It will also say that the report meets certain conditions set by the Commission's rules and regulations.\\n(b) Implementation of Safe Harbor The government agency will also have to figure out how to enforce this new safe harbor regulation.\\nAccording to this rule (subsection (a)), the Commission is not allowed to make certain conditions for a safe harbor related to a type of investment fund that is continuously distributing securities. They cannot make it a requirement for a broker or dealer to publish or distribute a research report on this investment fund in order to initiate or restart research coverage on the fund or its securities. The Commission also cannot require the investment fund to be registered as an investment company or subject to certain reporting requirements for a longer period of time than what is mentioned in another regulation. They also cannot impose a minimum provision that exceeds what is mentioned in that regulation. Furthermore, a self-regulatory organization cannot have a rule that prevents a member from publishing or distributing a research report on the investment fund solely because the member is participating in a registered offering or distribution of any securities of that investment fund. The organization also cannot prevent a member from participating in a registered offering or distribution of securities of the investment fund solely because the member has published or distributed a research report on that investment fund or its securities. Lastly, a research report on the investment fund is not subject to a specific section of another law and its regulations, except if it does not meet the content standards set by self-regulatory organizations regarding research reports on investment companies or similar standards.\\n(c) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as in any way limiting--\\n(1) the applicability of the antifraud or antimanipulation provisions of the Federal securities laws and rules adopted thereunder to a covered investment fund research report, including section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77q), section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b)), and sections 9 and 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78i, 78j); or\\n(2) the authority of any self-regulatory organization to examine or supervise a member's practices in connection with such member's publication or distribution of a covered investment fund research report for compliance with applicable provisions of the Federal securities laws or self-regulatory organization rules related to research reports, including those contained in rules governing communications with the public.\\n(d) Interim Effectiveness of Safe Harbor.--\\n(1) In general.-- From and after the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, if the Commission has not adopted revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, as required by subsection (a), and until such time as the Commission has done so, a broker or dealer distributing or publishing a covered investment fund research report after such date shall be able to rely on the provisions of section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, and the broker or dealer's publication of such report shall be deemed to satisfy the conditions of.\\nParagraph (a\\n(1) or (a)(2) of that section if the covered investment fund that is the subject of such report satisfies the reporting history requirements (without regard to Form S-3 or Form F-3 eligibility) and minimum float provisions of such subsections for purposes of the Commission's rules and regulations under the Federal securities laws and the rules of any self-regulatory organization, as if revised and implemented in accordance with subsections (a) and (b).\\nTranslation: If the investment fund being talked about in the report meets certain requirements set by the government and other organizations, then paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of that section applies.\\n(2) Status of covered investment fund.--After such period and until the Commission has adopted revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, and FINRA has revised rule 2210, for purposes of subsection (c)(7)(O) of such rule, a covered investment fund shall be deemed to be a security that is listed on a national securities exchange and that is not subject to section 24(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)). Communications concerning only covered investment funds that fall within the scope of such section shall not be required to be filed with FINRA.\\nTranslation: Until certain changes are made by the government and other organizations, a covered investment fund is considered to be a type of investment that is listed on a national exchange and not subject to certain rules. People don't have to submit certain documents to FINRA if they are only talking about these specific investment funds.\\n(e) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\\n(1) The term \"covered investment fund research report\" means a research report published or distributed by a broker or dealer about a covered investment fund or any securities issued by the covered investment fund, but does not include a research report to the extent that the research report is published or distributed by the covered investment fund or any affiliate of the covered investment fund.\\nTranslation: In this law, the term \"covered investment fund research report\" refers to a report made by a broker or dealer about a certain type of investment fund or the securities it issues. However, it doesn't include reports made by the investment fund itself or any of its related companies.\\n(2) The term \"covered investment fund\" means: (A) a company that invests money for people and has registered with the government or chosen to be treated as a special type of company, and has also filed paperwork to sell a type of investment to the public.

UNIFIED PASS-THRU ENTITY REGIME.\\n(a) Termination of S Corporation Status. (1) No new S corporation elections. People cannot choose to become an S corporation after December 31, 2004.\\n(2) Termination of status. After 2014, S corporations will be treated as partnerships for tax purposes.\\n(3) Effective date. These changes will apply to tax years starting after December 31, 2004.\\n(b) Election by Certain Corporations to Be Taxed as Partnership. (1) In general. A corporation can choose to be taxed as a partnership.\\n(2) Tax treatment of S corporation electing unified pass-thru regime. The shareholders of an S corporation that chooses to be taxed as a partnership will be treated as if they received a distribution of the corporation's assets in exchange for their stock. Any gain or loss from this distribution will be spread out over the following five years.\\n(3) Modification to treatment of section 1374 tax for earnings and profits purposes. \\nThis part is talking about changing the way taxes are calculated for a certain type of corporation. It says that the amount of money made from selling assets and any deductions allowed for taxes should not be included when calculating the taxes for this type of corporation. Additionally, the amount of money the corporation has saved up over the years should be increased at the beginning of the year by the amount of money not included in the calculations (minus the taxes already paid).\\nEffect of election on recognition period for purposes of tax imposed on built-in gains.\\nThis part is about how a certain type of tax is applied to corporations. It says that the \"recognition period,\" which is the amount of time the tax applies, is normally 10 years starting from the first year the corporation became a certain type of corporation. But if the corporation chooses to be taxed differently, the recognition period will be 25 years instead. However, if the 10-year period has already passed when the corporation makes the choice, then it will still only be 10 years.\\nStep Transaction Doctrine not to Apply to Partnership Incorporation Followed by Corporate Reorganization.\\nThis part is about a rule that applies when a partnership becomes a corporation and then reorganizes. It says that a certain legal principle called the \"step transaction doctrine\" should not be used to determine if the control requirement is met in this case. It only applies when a partnership transfers most of its assets to a privately owned corporation and then the corporation goes through a reorganization process.\\nPartnership Income Attributable to Capital Excluded from Net Earnings from Self-Employment.\\nThis part is about how income from partnerships is taxed. It says that the income a partner receives from their ownership in a partnership that is considered \"capital income\" should be excluded from the calculation of their self-employment income. Instead, only the income from the partner's services should be considered. The specific definition of \"capital income\" is also given, which includes any excess money the partner has invested in the partnership and a fair rate of return on that investment.\\nA \"reasonable rate of return on unreturned capital\" means that if someone gives money to a business and doesn't get it back, the business should give them 150% of the highest interest rate set by the government at the beginning of the year. The government can also set a higher interest rate if they want.\\nThe government will make rules (called regulations) to make sure this happens.\\nThese rules will start applying to money given to businesses after December 31, 2004.</td>\n",

SAFE HARBOR FOR INVESTMENT FUND RESEARCH\\n(a) Expansion of the Safe Harbor The government agency in charge of regulating securities and investments (called the Securities and Exchange Commission) has to make some changes to a specific regulation within 180 days of this law being passed. These changes are meant to protect investors and promote the creation of new investments. The new regulation will say that a report about a specific investment fund, written by a broker or dealer, will not be considered a sale offer or a solicitation for that investment fund's securities, even if the broker is involved in selling those securities. It will also say that the report meets certain conditions set by the Commission's rules and regulations.\\n(b) Implementation of Safe Harbor The government agency will also have to figure out how to enforce this new safe harbor regulation.\\nAccording to this rule (subsection (a)), the Commission is not allowed to make certain conditions for a safe harbor related to a type of investment fund that is continuously distributing securities. They cannot make it a requirement for a broker or dealer to publish or distribute a research report on this investment fund in order to initiate or restart research coverage on the fund or its securities. The Commission also cannot require the investment fund to be registered as an investment company or subject to certain reporting requirements for a longer period of time than what is mentioned in another regulation. They also cannot impose a minimum provision that exceeds what is mentioned in that regulation. Furthermore, a self-regulatory organization cannot have a rule that prevents a member from publishing or distributing a research report on the investment fund solely because the member is participating in a registered offering or distribution of any securities of that investment fund. The organization also cannot prevent a member from participating in a registered offering or distribution of securities of the investment fund solely because the member has published or distributed a research report on that investment fund or its securities. Lastly, a research report on the investment fund is not subject to a specific section of another law and its regulations, except if it does not meet the content standards set by self-regulatory organizations regarding research reports on investment companies or similar standards.\\n(c) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as in any way limiting--\\n(1) the applicability of the antifraud or antimanipulation provisions of the Federal securities laws and rules adopted thereunder to a covered investment fund research report, including section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77q), section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b)), and sections 9 and 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78i, 78j); or\\n(2) the authority of any self-regulatory organization to examine or supervise a member's practices in connection with such member's publication or distribution of a covered investment fund research report for compliance with applicable provisions of the Federal securities laws or self-regulatory organization rules related to research reports, including those contained in rules governing communications with the public.\\n(d) Interim Effectiveness of Safe Harbor.--\\n(1) In general.-- From and after the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, if the Commission has not adopted revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, as required by subsection (a), and until such time as the Commission has done so, a broker or dealer distributing or publishing a covered investment fund research report after such date shall be able to rely on the provisions of section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, and the broker or dealer's publication of such report shall be deemed to satisfy the conditions of.\\nParagraph (a\\n(1) or (a)(2) of that section if the covered investment fund that is the subject of such report satisfies the reporting history requirements (without regard to Form S-3 or Form F-3 eligibility) and minimum float provisions of such subsections for purposes of the Commission's rules and regulations under the Federal securities laws and the rules of any self-regulatory organization, as if revised and implemented in accordance with subsections (a) and (b).\\nTranslation: If the investment fund being talked about in the report meets certain requirements set by the government and other organizations, then paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of that section applies.\\n(2) Status of covered investment fund.--After such period and until the Commission has adopted revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, and FINRA has revised rule 2210, for purposes of subsection (c)(7)(O) of such rule, a covered investment fund shall be deemed to be a security that is listed on a national securities exchange and that is not subject to section 24(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)). Communications concerning only covered investment funds that fall within the scope of such section shall not be required to be filed with FINRA.\\nTranslation: Until certain changes are made by the government and other organizations, a covered investment fund is considered to be a type of investment that is listed on a national exchange and not subject to certain rules. People don't have to submit certain documents to FINRA if they are only talking about these specific investment funds.\\n(e) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\\n(1) The term \"covered investment fund research report\" means a research report published or distributed by a broker or dealer about a covered investment fund or any securities issued by the covered investment fund, but does not include a research report to the extent that the research report is published or distributed by the covered investment fund or any affiliate of the covered investment fund.\\nTranslation: In this law, the term \"covered investment fund research report\" refers to a report made by a broker or dealer about a certain type of investment fund or the securities it issues. However, it doesn't include reports made by the investment fund itself or any of its related companies.\\n(2) The term \"covered investment fund\" means: (A) a company that invests money for people and has registered with the government or chosen to be treated as a special type of company, and has also filed paperwork to sell a type of investment to the public.
