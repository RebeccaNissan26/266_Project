USE OF INCENTIVES TO RESTORE FOREST SERVICE FINANCIAL \\n              ACCOUNTABILITY.\\n\\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Section 3521(e) of title 31, United States Code, \\n        requires the Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture \\n        to audit the annual financial statements required to be \\n        prepared by the Forest Service. As a result of the inability of \\n        the Forest Service to produce reliable financial statements, \\n        the agency has received four successive adverse opinions or \\n        disclaimers from the Inspector General.\\n            (2) In January 1999, the Comptroller General submitted a \\n        report to Congress that identified the Forest Service as an \\n        agency at ``high risk'' of waste, fraud, abuse, and \\n        mismanagement due to the persistent and severe weaknesses in \\n        the Forest Service's accounting and financial reporting \\n        systems.\\n            (3) The Comptroller General has stated that the Forest \\n        Service will maintain its high risk status until the agency, at \\n        a minimum--\\n                    (A) receives two consecutive unqualified audit \\n                opinions from the Inspector General; and\\n                    (B) corrects the material internal control \\n                weaknesses, identified in the Inspector General's audit \\n                reports of the financial statements of the Forest \\n                Service, which adversely affect the ability of the \\n                Forest Service to maintain accountability over its \\n                assets on an ongoing basis.\\n            (4) Despite initial efforts on the part of the Forest \\n        Service to correct deficiencies in its financial management \\n        systems, the Comptroller General and the Inspector General of \\n        the Department of Agriculture have indicated that the Forest \\n        Service may still be years away from producing reliable \\n        financial statements or changing its high risk status.\\n            (5) Performance incentives are necessary to ultimately \\n        restore financial accountability to the Forest Service, and \\n        such incentives must be structured so as to preserve the \\n        ability of the Forest Service to perform its core missions, \\n        particularly a sustained reduction of the natural resources \\n        restoration and maintenance backlog within the National Forest \\n        System, while safeguarding further investments of taxpayer \\n        dollars from waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\\n    (b) Conditional Limitations on Forest Service Appropriations.--\\nSubject to subsections (c) and (d), for fiscal years beginning after \\nthe date of the enactment of this Act, the total amount appropriated \\nfor the Forest Service to carry out discretionary programs and \\nactivities for a fiscal year shall not exceed the sum of the amounts \\nappropriated under the heading ``Forest Service'' in title II of the \\nDepartment of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \\n1999 (as contained in section 101(e) of division A of Public Law 105-\\n277; 112 Stat. 2681-268).\\n    (c) Removal of Condition.--The limitations on the level of Forest \\nService appropriations or obligations specified in subsection (b) shall \\nterminate on the earlier of the following:\\n            (1) The date on which the Forest Service is no longer an \\n        agency at high risk of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement \\n        due to weaknesses in its accounting and financial reporting \\n        systems, as determined under subsection (d).\\n            (2) The end of the fifth fiscal year subject to the \\n        limitations.\\n    (d) Criteria for Removal of High Risk Status.--The Forest Service \\nshall no longer be an agency at high risk under subsection (c)(1) if \\nthe Comptroller General certifies in writing to Congress that Forest \\nService financial management is no longer at high risk. The Comptroller \\nGeneral may make that certification only if--\\n            (1) the Forest Service receives two consecutive unqualified \\n        audit opinions from the Inspector General of the Department of \\n        Agriculture under section 3521(e) of title 31, United States \\n        Code; and\\n            (2) the Forest Service corrects the material weaknesses \\n        identified in the audit reports of the Inspector General \\n        regarding the Forest Service's fiscal year 1995 financial \\n        statements and all subsequent audit reports of the Inspector \\n        General regarding the Forest Service's financial statements \\n        published before the date of the enactment of this Act.\\n    (e) Backlog Reduction Outputs.--During each fiscal year identified \\nin subsection (c)(2), the Forest Service shall maintain or increase \\noutputs, relative to the levels achieved during fiscal year 1999, from \\nprograms that directly reduce the natural resources restoration and \\nmaintenance backlog within the National Forest System. Such outputs \\nshall include the following:\\n            (1) Acres of forested land treated for reduction of \\n        wildfire risk.\\n            (2) Acres of forested land treated for reduction of \\n        mortality risk from insect and disease infestation.\\n            (3) Miles of roads and trails reconstructed or maintained.\\n            (4) Number of recreational facilities reconstructed or \\n        maintained.\\n            (5) Acres of terrestrial habitat restored or enhanced.\\n            (6) Miles of riparian areas restored or enhanced.\\n            (7) Other priority outputs identified by the Secretary.   \n",

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Forest Service Financial \\nAccountability Restoration Act of 1999''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. USE OF INCENTIVES TO RESTORE FOREST SERVICE FINANCIAL \\n              ACCOUNTABILITY.\\n\\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Section 3521(e) of title 31, United States Code, \\n        requires the Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture \\n        to audit the annual financial statements required to be \\n        prepared by the Forest Service. As a result of the inability of \\n        the Forest Service to produce reliable financial statements, \\n        the agency has received four successive adverse opinions or \\n        disclaimers from the Inspector General.\\n            (2) In January 1999, the Comptroller General submitted a \\n        report to Congress that identified the Forest Service as an \\n        agency at ``high risk'' of waste, fraud, abuse, and \\n        mismanagement due to the persistent and severe weaknesses in \\n        the Forest Service's accounting and financial reporting \\n        systems.\\n            (3) The Comptroller General has stated that the Forest \\n        Service will maintain its high risk status until the agency, at \\n        a minimum--\\n                    (A) receives two consecutive unqualified audit \\n                opinions from the Inspector General; and\\n                    (B) corrects the material internal control \\n                weaknesses, identified in the Inspector General's audit \\n                reports of the financial statements of the Forest \\n                Service, which adversely affect the ability of the \\n                Forest Service to maintain accountability over its \\n                assets on an ongoing basis.\\n            (4) Despite initial efforts on the part of the Forest \\n        Service to correct deficiencies in its financial management \\n        systems, the Comptroller General and the Inspector General of \\n        the Department of Agriculture have indicated that the Forest \\n        Service may still be years away from producing reliable \\n        financial statements or changing its high risk status.\\n            (5) Performance incentives are necessary to ultimately \\n        restore financial accountability to the Forest Service, and \\n        such incentives must be structured so as to preserve the \\n        ability of the Forest Service to perform its core missions, \\n        particularly a sustained reduction of the natural resources \\n        restoration and maintenance backlog within the National Forest \\n        System, while safeguarding further investments of taxpayer \\n        dollars from waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\\n    (b) Conditional Limitations on Forest Service Appropriations.--\\nSubject to subsections (c) and (d), for fiscal years beginning after \\nthe date of the enactment of this Act, the total amount appropriated \\nfor the Forest Service to carry out discretionary programs and \\nactivities for a fiscal year shall not exceed the sum of the amounts \\nappropriated under the heading ``Forest Service'' in title II of the \\nDepartment of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \\n1999 (as contained in section 101(e) of division A of Public Law 105-\\n277; 112 Stat. 2681-268).\\n    (c) Removal of Condition.--The limitations on the level of Forest \\nService appropriations or obligations specified in subsection (b) shall \\nterminate on the earlier of the following:\\n            (1) The date on which the Forest Service is no longer an \\n        agency at high risk of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement \\n        due to weaknesses in its accounting and financial reporting \\n        systems, as determined under subsection (d).\\n            (2) The end of the fifth fiscal year subject to the \\n        limitations.\\n    (d) Criteria for Removal of High Risk Status.--The Forest Service \\nshall no longer be an agency at high risk under subsection (c)(1) if \\nthe Comptroller General certifies in writing to Congress that Forest \\nService financial management is no longer at high risk. The Comptroller \\nGeneral may make that certification only if--\\n            (1) the Forest Service receives two consecutive unqualified \\n        audit opinions from the Inspector General of the Department of \\n        Agriculture under section 3521(e) of title 31, United States \\n        Code; and\\n            (2) the Forest Service corrects the material weaknesses \\n        identified in the audit reports of the Inspector General \\n        regarding the Forest Service's fiscal year 1995 financial \\n        statements and all subsequent audit reports of the Inspector \\n        General regarding the Forest Service's financial statements \\n        published before the date of the enactment of this Act.\\n    (e) Backlog Reduction Outputs.--During each fiscal year identified \\nin subsection (c)(2), the Forest Service shall maintain or increase \\noutputs, relative to the levels achieved during fiscal year 1999, from \\nprograms that directly reduce the natural resources restoration and \\nmaintenance backlog within the National Forest System. Such outputs \\nshall include the following:\\n            (1) Acres of forested land treated for reduction of \\n        wildfire risk.\\n            (2) Acres of forested land treated for reduction of \\n        mortality risk from insect and disease infestation.\\n            (3) Miles of roads and trails reconstructed or maintained.\\n            (4) Number of recreational facilities reconstructed or \\n        maintained.\\n            (5) Acres of terrestrial habitat restored or enhanced.\\n            (6) Miles of riparian areas restored or enhanced.\\n            (7) Other priority outputs identified by the Secretary.   \n",

                    SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as ``Foreign Credit Reform Act of 2004''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Unsustainable debt in the world's poorest countries \\n        constitutes a serious impediment to the development of stable \\n        democratic political structures, broad-based economic growth, \\n        poverty eradication, and food security.\\n            (2) Financing should be appropriate for the purposes for \\n        which it is used and should, to the maximum extent possible, \\n        generate a return sufficient to pay the principal and interest \\n        due. As such, long-term lending for perishable goods, such as \\n        food commodities, may be construed as inappropriate to the \\n        extent that it places a long-term debt burden on the recipient \\n        country without generating sufficient revenues with which to \\n        service the debt.\\n            (3) Since 1955, the United States has extended more than \\n        $27,800,000,000 in loans for food under title I of the \\n        Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 \\n        (commonly referred to as ``PL 480''), $10,632,858,000 of which \\n        remained outstanding at the end of 2002.\\n            (4) As of December 31, 2002, arrears on principal and \\n        interest payments under title I of PL 480 totaled \\n        $1,241,472,000.\\n            (5) Since 1992 the United States provided the independent \\n        states of the former Soviet Union with $1,601,500,000 in loans \\n        for food under title I of PL 480, for which these countries are \\n        estimated to have paid $112,748,000 in principal and interest \\n        in 2003. Russia alone has received $1,035,000,000 in credits, \\n        paying an estimated $79,695,000 in principal and interest in \\n        2003.\\n            (6) Rising debt stocks and debt-to-export ratios may \\n        undermine a country's credit worthiness and jeopardize its \\n        ability to borrow from commercial lenders.\\n            (7) Debt reduction contributes marginally to a country's \\n        development prospects if new debt is allowed to create the next \\n        generation of heavy indebtedness. Therefore, President Bush's \\n        initiative, adopted by Group of Seven (G-7) leaders at the June \\n        2002 summit, to increase World Bank grant assistance to the \\n        most heavily indebted poor countries is a crucial step toward \\n        alleviating poverty, curbing future unsustainable debt, and \\n        providing for urgent human needs in countries in which people \\n        live on less than one dollar a day. Replacing loans with \\n        targeted grants will eliminate the need for governments to \\n        repay long-term investments in people, especially for \\n        education, health, nutrition, water supply, and sanitation \\n        purposes.\\n            (8) The G-7 agreement at the June 2002 summit to fully fund \\n        the remaining costs of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor \\n        Country (HIPC) initiative is essential to ensuring that \\n        eligible debt-distressed nations receive full benefits under \\n        the HIPC debt relief measure.\\n            (9) The United States has been a leading voice for more \\n        than a decade in international debt reduction initiatives for \\n        poor countries, including a 1991 initiative to cancel \\n        $689,000,000 in food loans under title I of PL 480 owed by 15 \\n        sub-Saharan African countries.\\n            (10) The United States must continue its leadership role to \\n        encourage full participation by all Paris Club creditors in \\n        multilateral debt negotiations.\\n            (11) Several poor countries that are not eligible for \\n        enhanced HIPC debt reduction terms face a severe debt overhang \\n        that undermines increased resource allocation for development \\n        and discourages productive investment.\\n            (12) The World Bank, which has provided over $1,700,000,000 \\n        since 1986 to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS, should continue to \\n        place the highest priority on programs to combat infectious \\n        diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.\\n            (13) Debt reduction is an important, but only partial \\n        solution to long-term development. Promoting an environment \\n        that will stimulate internal economic growth, promote trade and \\n        external investment, and encourage responsible governance are \\n        the most important ingredients for sustainable growth.\\n\\n                   TITLE I--MULTILATERAL DEBT RELIEF\\n\\nSEC. 101.

Such land may not be disposed of by the town without Interior's approval.  Interior may develop a special management plan for the recreation area to enhance the safe use of off-highway vehicles for recreational purposes. Interior shall convey, without consideration, the surface estate of specified lands to the cities of Twentynine Palms, Barstow, and Victorville in California.

Any state action to lease, permit, or regulate oil and gas exploration and development shall not be subject to, or considered, a federal action, a federal permit, or a federal license with respect to specified administrative and environmental laws and is therefore exempt from them.  State-issued leases or permits must provide for: (1) the collection of royalties or other revenues in an amount equal to what would have been collected if the lease or permit had been federally issued, and (2) their deposit into the same federal account in which they would have been deposited if the lease or permit had been federally issued.  A state may collect and retain lease or permit application processing fees.    \n",

USE OF INCENTIVES TO RESTORE FOREST SERVICE FINANCIAL \\n              ACCOUNTABILITY.\\n\\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Section 3521(e) of title 31, United States Code, \\n        requires the Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture \\n        to audit the annual financial statements required to be \\n        prepared by the Forest Service. As a result of the inability of \\n        the Forest Service to produce reliable financial statements, \\n        the agency has received four successive adverse opinions or \\n        disclaimers from the Inspector General.\\n            (2) In January 1999, the Comptroller General submitted a \\n        report to Congress that identified the Forest Service as an \\n        agency at ``high risk'' of waste, fraud, abuse, and \\n        mismanagement due to the persistent and severe weaknesses in \\n        the Forest Service's accounting and financial reporting \\n        systems.\\n            (3) The Comptroller General has stated that the Forest \\n        Service will maintain its high risk status until the agency, at \\n        a minimum--\\n                    (A) receives two consecutive unqualified audit \\n                opinions from the Inspector General; and\\n                    (B) corrects the material internal control \\n                weaknesses, identified in the Inspector General's audit \\n                reports of the financial statements of the Forest \\n                Service, which adversely affect the ability of the \\n                Forest Service to maintain accountability over its \\n                assets on an ongoing basis.\\n            (4) Despite initial efforts on the part of the Forest \\n        Service to correct deficiencies in its financial management \\n        systems, the Comptroller General and the Inspector General of \\n        the Department of Agriculture have indicated that the Forest \\n        Service may still be years away from producing reliable \\n        financial statements or changing its high risk status.\\n            (5) Performance incentives are necessary to ultimately \\n        restore financial accountability to the Forest Service, and \\n        such incentives must be structured so as to preserve the \\n        ability of the Forest Service to perform its core missions, \\n        particularly a sustained reduction of the natural resources \\n        restoration and maintenance backlog within the National Forest \\n        System, while safeguarding further investments of taxpayer \\n        dollars from waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\\n    (b) Conditional Limitations on Forest Service Appropriations.--\\nSubject to subsections (c) and (d), for fiscal years beginning after \\nthe date of the enactment of this Act, the total amount appropriated \\nfor the Forest Service to carry out discretionary programs and \\nactivities for a fiscal year shall not exceed the sum of the amounts \\nappropriated under the heading ``Forest Service'' in title II of the \\nDepartment of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \\n1999 (as contained in section 101(e) of division A of Public Law 105-\\n277; 112 Stat. 2681-268).\\n    (c) Removal of Condition.--The limitations on the level of Forest \\nService appropriations or obligations specified in subsection (b) shall \\nterminate on the earlier of the following:\\n            (1) The date on which the Forest Service is no longer an \\n        agency at high risk of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement \\n        due to weaknesses in its accounting and financial reporting \\n        systems, as determined under subsection (d).\\n            (2) The end of the fifth fiscal year subject to the \\n        limitations.\\n    (d) Criteria for Removal of High Risk Status.--The Forest Service \\nshall no longer be an agency at high risk under subsection (c)(1) if \\nthe Comptroller General certifies in writing to Congress that Forest \\nService financial management is no longer at high risk. The Comptroller \\nGeneral may make that certification only if--\\n            (1) the Forest Service receives two consecutive unqualified \\n        audit opinions from the Inspector General of the Department of \\n        Agriculture under section 3521(e) of title 31, United States \\n        Code; and\\n            (2) the Forest Service corrects the material weaknesses \\n        identified in the audit reports of the Inspector General \\n        regarding the Forest Service's fiscal year 1995 financial \\n        statements and all subsequent audit reports of the Inspector \\n        General regarding the Forest Service's financial statements \\n        published before the date of the enactment of this Act.\\n    (e) Backlog Reduction Outputs.--During each fiscal year identified \\nin subsection (c)(2), the Forest Service shall maintain or increase \\noutputs, relative to the levels achieved during fiscal year 1999, from \\nprograms that directly reduce the natural resources restoration and \\nmaintenance backlog within the National Forest System. Such outputs \\nshall include the following:\\n            (1) Acres of forested land treated for reduction of \\n        wildfire risk.\\n            (2) Acres of forested land treated for reduction of \\n        mortality risk from insect and disease infestation.\\n            (3) Miles of roads and trails reconstructed or maintained.\\n            (4) Number of recreational facilities reconstructed or \\n        maintained.\\n            (5) Acres of terrestrial habitat restored or enhanced.\\n            (6) Miles of riparian areas restored or enhanced.\\n            (7) Other priority outputs identified by the Secretary.</td>\n",

FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Unsustainable debt in the world's poorest countries \\n        constitutes a serious impediment to the development of stable \\n        democratic political structures, broad-based economic growth, \\n        poverty eradication, and food security.\\n            (2) Financing should be appropriate for the purposes for \\n        which it is used and should, to the maximum extent possible, \\n        generate a return sufficient to pay the principal and interest \\n        due. As such, long-term lending for perishable goods, such as \\n        food commodities, may be construed as inappropriate to the \\n        extent that it places a long-term debt burden on the recipient \\n        country without generating sufficient revenues with which to \\n        service the debt.\\n            (3) Since 1955, the United States has extended more than \\n        $27,800,000,000 in loans for food under title I of the \\n        Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 \\n        (commonly referred to as ``PL 480''), $10,632,858,000 of which \\n        remained outstanding at the end of 2002.\\n            (4) As of December 31, 2002, arrears on principal and \\n        interest payments under title I of PL 480 totaled \\n        $1,241,472,000.\\n            (5) Since 1992 the United States provided the independent \\n        states of the former Soviet Union with $1,601,500,000 in loans \\n        for food under title I of PL 480, for which these countries are \\n        estimated to have paid $112,748,000 in principal and interest \\n        in 2003. Russia alone has received $1,035,000,000 in credits, \\n        paying an estimated $79,695,000 in principal and interest in \\n        2003.\\n            (6) Rising debt stocks and debt-to-export ratios may \\n        undermine a country's credit worthiness and jeopardize its \\n        ability to borrow from commercial lenders.\\n            (7) Debt reduction contributes marginally to a country's \\n        development prospects if new debt is allowed to create the next \\n        generation of heavy indebtedness. Therefore, President Bush's \\n        initiative, adopted by Group of Seven (G-7) leaders at the June \\n        2002 summit, to increase World Bank grant assistance to the \\n        most heavily indebted poor countries is a crucial step toward \\n        alleviating poverty, curbing future unsustainable debt, and \\n        providing for urgent human needs in countries in which people \\n        live on less than one dollar a day. Replacing loans with \\n        targeted grants will eliminate the need for governments to \\n        repay long-term investments in people, especially for \\n        education, health, nutrition, water supply, and sanitation \\n        purposes.\\n            (8) The G-7 agreement at the June 2002 summit to fully fund \\n        the remaining costs of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor \\n        Country (HIPC) initiative is essential to ensuring that \\n        eligible debt-distressed nations receive full benefits under \\n        the HIPC debt relief measure.\\n            (9) The United States has been a leading voice for more \\n        than a decade in international debt reduction initiatives for \\n        poor countries, including a 1991 initiative to cancel \\n        $689,000,000 in food loans under title I of PL 480 owed by 15 \\n        sub-Saharan African countries.\\n            (10) The United States must continue its leadership role to \\n        encourage full participation by all Paris Club creditors in \\n        multilateral debt negotiations.\\n            (11) Several poor countries that are not eligible for \\n        enhanced HIPC debt reduction terms face a severe debt overhang \\n        that undermines increased resource allocation for development \\n        and discourages productive investment.\\n            (12) The World Bank, which has provided over $1,700,000,000 \\n        since 1986 to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS, should continue to \\n        place the highest priority on programs to combat infectious \\n        diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.\\n            (13) Debt reduction is an important, but only partial \\n        solution to long-term development. Promoting an environment \\n        that will stimulate internal economic growth, promote trade and \\n        external investment, and encourage responsible governance are \\n        the most important ingredients for sustainable growth.\\n\\n                   TITLE I--MULTILATERAL DEBT RELIEF\\n\\nSEC. 101.
