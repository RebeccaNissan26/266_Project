# 266_Project
This repo contains my code, report PDF, and slides for the 266 (NLP) Final Project (which I completed as part of UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science program).
My project explores (1) the impact of finetuning T5 for summarizaing legislative documents and (2) whether pre-preprocessing or simplifying the test set improves model performance.
